### ENV
#### Tutorial
```js
TOKEN = 'Your user token'
STATUS = ['status 1', 'status 2', 'status 3'] // You can add more.
STATUS_DELAY = 10 // Seconds. | I recommend you to don't add lower than 10 seconds because you can get banned by spamming the databases.
```

#### Examples
```js
TOKEN = 'NaYGwmiJnwjnJjwma' // Not real token.
STATUS = ['a game.', 'in twitch.']
STATUS_DELAY = 15
```
